## Lecture: 02
- Image is defined as 2D function f(x,y)
- x,y are spatial coordinates
- amplitude of f at x,y is called intensity or gray level of image at that point
- **Digital image: when x, y and f(x,y) are finite and discrete quantities**
- smallest unit of image = pixel or pels or image element
- image = row x col (MxN)
- pixel representated by k bits so 2^k different values 
- i.e k=8 so values = 256 (0 to 255) where 0 or black and 255 for white
- therse values are called gray level
- **Image Processing: a method to convert an image into digital form and perform some operation on it to
get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it**

### Image processing to computer vision: low,mid and high level process
1. low level : input-> image ; output-> image
  - example: noise removal, sharening
2. mid level : input-> Image ; output-> attributes
  - examples: object recognition, segmentation
3. high level: input -> attributes ; output-> understanding
  - example: scene understanding, auto navigation

### Method for Image Processing
1.**Analog image processing:**
  - image are manipulated by electrical means by varying the
  - electric signals: television image
  - continious values
2. Digital Image processing: 
  - manipulate digital image by computers

## Lecture:2 
### Natural Image Processing
- Sources of Images: paintings,photographs, Journals, digital library, newspaper
-  reflective form imaging: use sensors to acquire images
-  Emissive type imaging: 
-   Transmissive imaging
## Lecture:03
### Representations of Digital images
- image = f(x,y)
- Resolution of image: It is the ability to produce the smallest discernable details 
- i.e The smallest sized object clearly and differentiate it from the neighboring small objects
- Optical resilution and spatial resolution
- The number of bits necessary to encode the pixel value is called bit depth.
- i.e for binary image pixel value = 0 and 1 (one bit)
- for gray scale image pixel value = 0 to 255 (8 bit)
- total no of bits to represent image = rowxcolxbit depth
- 3D image f(x,y,z) --> voxel
- Image processing operations:
1. Low level Operations
2. High Level Operations
### Low Level Operations: Traditional Image processing
1. Pixel Operations
2. Neighborhood Operations
3. Edge Level Operations
4. Region level operations
5. feature level operations

## Lecture 4
### Elements of Image Processing Systems
1. Image Acquistion Equipments (Video, Camera, Scanner)
2. Storage (Disks, Videotape)
3. Processing unit (computer)
4. Display Unit (TV Monitor, Slide, Projectors)

- Fundamental steps in DIP:
1. Image acquistion
2. Image Enhancement
3. Image Restoration
4. Morphological processing
5. Segmentation
6. Object recognition
7. Representation and descreption
8. Image Compression
- Segmentation: It is the process of patition an image into its constituents parts or obejects
- 

## Lecture 5
### Types of Image (natural or Synthetic)
- Based on Attributes (Raster and vector)
  - Raster image = pixel based (quality depends on on of pixels)
  - vector graphics (use geometric attributes i.e lines, circles to describe image
- Based on Color (
- Dimension
- Data Types
