### Lecture: 5 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
#### Types of Generative Models: 
-  1. Explicit Density (i.e VAE, Autoregressive Neural Networks)
-  2. Implicit Density (i.e GANs)
### GANs parts:
- Generators (take random sample vectir from latent space z and generate image)
- Discriminator( a binary classifier i.e. Real vs fake)
- The Goal of generator is to generate images which are similar to real images and it is not able to be distinguished by Discriminiator.( to fool Discriminator)
- The Goal of Discriminator is to distinguish images generated by Generator(Fake Image) from real images.
- Generator try to generate images which look real.
- latent random varable (Z) --->  Guassian Distribution
- Two loss:
      -  1. Discriminator loss (Binary cross entropy) --J(d)
      -  2. Generator loss-  opposite of D (-J(D))
-Training:
  - Minimax Game:
  - G minimize probability that D is correct
  - Equilibrium is saddle point of discriminator loss
- Good Training: Genertor loss should go down with time and discriminator loss should increase with time
- Curves are constant with time 

- problems with GAN:
   - Global structures (structures which look like real world images but are not)
   - GANs are dificult to evaluate
   - Do they memorize or generalize ?
   ### Inception Score(IS) -measure of GAN(
   - Measure Salienc and diversity:
   - Check how accurate the classfier can recognizethe generated images
   - Saliency: Check whether the generated images can be classified with high confidence.(High score on single class)
   - Diversity: check whether we optain samples form all classes.
  
  #### GAN Training Hacks:
  -  normalize the input between -1 and 1
  -  tanh as last layer of the generator output
  -  No Brainer
  -  sample z from gaussian (shperical z)
  -  Use Batch Norm
  -  avoid sparse gradient
  -  use leaku ReLu
  -  Downsample --> Avg Pooling , conv+stride
  -  Upsample--> deconv+stride, pixelshuffle
  -  Exponential average weights (Problem if noise in D due to SGD)
 
- **New Objective functions (GAN Types)**
- Energy based GAN (EBGAN)
- Least Square GAN (LSGAN)
- Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN)
-  WGAN

###EBGAN :
- Discriminator is energy based

### DCGAN:
- Deep convolution GAN
- Take random vector z and produces images by upsampling (Deconv)--- similar to decoding for image construction
